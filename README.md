# Iceberg-Lettuce-Quality-Classification-Using-CNN-and-Chemical-Analysis
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of Iceberg lettuce treated with different chemical solutions (Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Chitosan) at various concentrations. Each class is enriched with chemical compound readings like Flavonoids, Phenolics, and Tannins, which help in understanding the biochemical impact of treatments on lettuce quality.
# Project Overview
The goal is to develop a deep learning model that can classify lettuce samples based on image data while also analyzing associated chemical properties. This approach helps bridge the gap between visual quality and chemical content, providing an innovative solution for automated lettuce health monitoring.
